These hooks are framework agnostic, so they can be used in Next.js, React, Svelte, and Vue.\n\nYou need to install the package for your framework, e.g.:\n\n```shell\nnpm install @ai-sdk/react\n```\n\n###### @/app/page.tsx (Next.js App Router)\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { messages, status, sendMessage } = useChat();\n  const [input, setInput] = useState('');\n  const handleSubmit = e => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    sendMessage({ text: input });\n    setInput('');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {messages.map(message => (\n        <div key={message.id}>\n          <strong>{`${message.role}: `}</strong>\n          {message.parts.map((part, index) => {\n            switch (part.type) {\n              case 'text':\n                return <span key={index}>{part.text}</span>;\n\n              // other cases can handle images, tool calls, etc\n            }\n          })}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <input\n          value={input}\n          placeholder=\"Send a message...\"\n          onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}\n          disabled={status !== 'ready'}\n        />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n###### @/app/api/chat/route.ts (Next.js App Router)\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n    system: 'You are a helpful assistant.',\n    messages,\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n## Templates\n\nWe've built [templates](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai) that include AI SDK integrations for different use cases, providers, and frameworks. You can use these templates to get started with your AI-powered application.\n\n## Community\n\nThe AI SDK community can be found on [the Vercel Community](https://community.vercel.com/c/ai-sdk/62) where you can ask questions, voice ideas, and share your projects with other people.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to the AI SDK are welcome and highly appreciated. However, before you jump right into it, we would like you to review our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to make sure you have smooth experience
