Only supported on node 20+.\n  - Basic, Bearer and PAT Support out of the box.  Extensible handlers for others.\n  - Redirects supported\n\nFeatures and releases [here](./RELEASES.md)\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install @actions/http-client --save\n```\n\n## Samples\n\nSee the [tests](./__tests__) for detailed examples.\n\n## Errors\n\n### HTTP\n\nThe HTTP client does not throw unless truly exceptional.\n\n* A request that successfully executes resulting in a 404, 500 etc... will return a response object with a status code and a body.\n* Redirects (3xx) will be followed by default.\n\nSee the [tests](./__tests__) for detailed examples.\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo enable detailed console logging of all HTTP requests and responses, set the NODE_DEBUG environment varible:\n\n```shell\nexport NODE_DEBUG=http\n```\n\n## Node support\n\nThe http-client is built using Node 24. It may work on previous node LTS versions but it's tested and officially supported on Node 20+.\n\n## Support and Versioning\n\nWe follow semver and will hold compatibility between major versions and increment the minor version with new features and capabilities (while holding compat).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome PRs.  Please create an issue and if applicable, a design before proceeding with code.\n\nonce:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nTo build:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```\nnpm
