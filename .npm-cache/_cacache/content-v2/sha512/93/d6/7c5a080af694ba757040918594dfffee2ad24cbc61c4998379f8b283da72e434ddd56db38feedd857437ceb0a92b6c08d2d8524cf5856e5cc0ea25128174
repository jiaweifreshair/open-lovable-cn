Logs are written to `~/playwright-mcp-server.log`.\n\n### HTTP Mode (Standalone Server)\n\nWhen running headed browser on systems without display or from worker processes of IDEs, you can run the MCP server as a standalone HTTP server:\n\n> **Note for Claude Desktop Users:** Claude Desktop currently requires stdio mode (command/args configuration). HTTP mode is recommended for VS Code, custom clients, and remote deployments. See [CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG.md](CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG.md) for details.\n\n#### Starting the HTTP Server\n\n```bash\n# Using npx\nnpx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --port 8931\n\n# Or after global installation\nplaywright-mcp-server --port 8931\n```\n\nThe server will start and display available endpoints:\n\n```\n==============================================\nPlaywright MCP Server (HTTP Mode)\n==============================================\nPort: 8931\n\nENDPOINTS:\n- SSE Stream:     GET  http://localhost:8931/sse\n- Messages:       POST http://localhost:8931/messages?sessionId=<id>\n- MCP (unified):  GET  http://localhost:8931/mcp\n- MCP (unified):  POST http://localhost:8931/mcp?sessionId=<id>\n- Health Check:   GET  http://localhost:8931/health\n==============================================\n```\n\n#### Client Configuration for HTTP Mode\n\n> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** The `\"type\": \"http\"` field is **REQUIRED** for HTTP/SSE transport!\n\n**For VS Code GitHub Copilot:**\n```json\n{\n  \"github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:8931/mcp\",\n      \"type\": \"http\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For Custom MCP Clients:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:8931/mcp\",\n      \"type\": \"http\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important:** Without `\"type\": \"http\"`, the connection will fail.\n\n**For Claude Desktop:** Use stdio mode instead (see Standard Mode above)\n\n#### Use Cases for HTTP Mode\n\n- Running headed browsers on systems without display (e.g., remote servers)\n- Integrating with VS Code GitHub Copilot\n- Running the server as a background service\n- Accessing the server from multiple clients\n- Debugging with the `/health` endpoint\n- Custom MCP client integrations\n\n**Monitoring:** The server includes a monitoring system that starts on a dynamically allocated port (avoiding conflicts). Check the console output for the actual port.\n\n**Note:** For Claude Desktop, continue using stdio mode (Standard Mode above) for now.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"No transport found for sessionId\" Error\n\n**Symptom:** 400 error with message \"Bad Request: No transport found for sessionId\"\n\n**Solution:**\n1. **Check configuration includes `\"type\": \"http\"`**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"url\": \"http://localhost:8931/mcp\",\n     \"type\": \"http\"  // ← This is REQUIRED!\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify server logs show connection:**\n   ```bash\n   # Should see these in order:\n   # 1. \"Incoming request\" - GET /mcp\n   # 2. \"Transport registered\" - with sessionId\n   # 3. \"POST message received\" - with same sessionId\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart both server and client**\n\n### Connection Issues\n\n- **Server not starting:** Check if port 8931 is available\n- **External access blocked:** This is by design (security). Server binds to localhost only\n- **For remote access:** Use SSH tunneling:\n  ```bash\n  ssh -L 8931:localhost:8931 user@remote-server\n  ```\n\n## Testing\n\nThis project uses Jest for testing. The tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nYou can run the tests using one of the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Run tests using the custom script (with coverage)\nnode run-tests.cjs\n\n# Run tests using npm scripts\nnpm test           # Run tests without coverage\nnpm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage\nnpm run test:custom    # Run tests with custom script (same as node run-tests.cjs)\n```\n\nThe test coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory.\n\n### Running evals\n\nThe evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).\n\n```bash\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval src/evals/evals.ts src/tools/codegen/index.ts\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWhen adding new tools, please be mindful of the tool name length. Some clients, like Cursor, have a 60-character limit for the combined server and tool name (`server_name:tool_name`).\n\nOur server name is `playwright-mcp`. Please ensure your tool names are short enough to not exceed this limit.\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=executeautomation/mcp-playwright&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#executeautomation/mcp-playwright&Date)\n","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-playwright.git"},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
